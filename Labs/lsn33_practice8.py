# Problem Description:
# Write a Python program that reads this file, and gets the following inputs from the user:
#    A start year
#    An end year
# Your program should output the age of the youngest actor during that time span
# (including the start and end years), as well as the names of all actors that are
# within 5 years (inclusive) of the youngest age.  For simplicity's sake, don't
# try to calculate the current age of the actors; just go with what is in the file.
