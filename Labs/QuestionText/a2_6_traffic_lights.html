<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>The City Manager is having a traffic problem and asked you are to write a program that will determine whether or not to activate a newly installed alternate traffic light schedule to help alleviate traffic throughout the city during peak traffic hours. Your program will ask for the number of traffic "time periods" to analyze. It will then ask for the traffic throughput (in average number of cars per minute, which does not have to be a whole number) for each "time period". Your program will keep track of how many "time periods" are considered heavy traffic, as defined as 15 cars per minutes or more (inclusive). Your program will then print one of the following statements:</p>
<table border="1" width="">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong># of "time periods" of heavy traffic</strong></td>
<td><strong>0</strong></td>
<td><strong>1-2</strong></td>
<td><strong>&gt;2</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Output</strong></td>
<td>Regular Schedule</td>
<td>Prepare Activation</td>
<td>Activate New Schedule</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
