<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</strong></p>
<p>You have been provided with a file named "cadets.csv" that contains information about (fake) cadets. Here is a line from the file:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><code>Karla Webber, Female, CS-17, 2020</code></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Each position in the line represents a different "data element." Here is a key for your reference:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table width="">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Gender</th>
<th>Squadron</th>
<th>Class Year</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Karla Webber</th>
<th>Female</th>
<th>CS-17</th>
<th>2020</th>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Write a Python program that opens the file and prints out the name of each cadet. For example, if the first three cadets are named Karla Webber, Kelsea Hood, Nicolle Terry the first three lines of output should be:</p>
<pre>Karla Webber<br />Kelsea Hood<br />Nicolle Terry</pre>
<p><strong>NOTES:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your solution should print out the names in the order that they were read from the file.</li>
<li>Your solution may print out the same name (e.g., John Smith) multiple times.</li>
</ul>
