<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong>You have been provided with a function called <code>draw_multiple_trees()</code> that outputs a tree using ASCII art. Unlike the previous problem, this function accepts a parameter that tells it how many trees to draw.</p>
<p>Write a program that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gets an integer from the user and stores it in a variable. You can name this variable whatever you want.</li>
<li>Calls the function, and passes the variable to it. </li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that "passing a value" to a function simply means putting the number inside the parenthesis when you call it.&nbsp;</p>
