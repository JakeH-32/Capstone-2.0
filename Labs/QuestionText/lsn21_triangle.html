<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>Write an algorithm that asks the user for X and Y coordinates of a single point (the coordinates of the top left point on the triangle), the length of the base, and the height of a right triangle. Then, open a graphics window and draw the triangle. The area of the triangle is should be displayed at the bottom center of the window in black.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HINTS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you get the user input BEFORE you open the window. Otherwise, the program will freeze.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<code>draw_text</code>&nbsp;function will draw text on a screen. Don't worry about getting the text EXACTLY in the center (it's hard!).</li>
</ul>
