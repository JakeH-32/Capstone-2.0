<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>Write a Python program that asks the user for the name of a file. Your program should then read this file and counts how many times each token (i.e., word) appears (NOTE: keep it simple, and split on the &ldquo; &ldquo;). Finally, let the user type a token, and print how many times that token appears (if a word is not in your dictionary, print 0).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HINTS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You have been provided with the file review.txt to test your code.</li>
</ul>
