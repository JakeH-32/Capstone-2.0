<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>Write a Python function that calculates the buoyancy force for an object. You will name your function <code>calculate_buoyancy</code>, and it will have the following parameters (in this order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Submerged Volume</li>
<li>Density</li>
<li>Gravity</li>
</ul>
<p>Our function will&nbsp;<strong>return</strong>&nbsp;the buoyancy force, which can be computed using the following equation:</p>
<p><strong>Fb = Vs &times; D &times; g&nbsp;</strong>where Fb is the buoyancy force, Vs is the submerged volume, D is the density of the fluid the object is submerged in, and g is the force of gravity.</p>
<p>NOTE: You do NOT need to call the function.</p>
