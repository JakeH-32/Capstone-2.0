<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</strong></p>
<p>You have been asked to write a program to get flying hours from a squadron of pilots for the month. Write a Python program that asks the user to repeatedly type in the name of a pilot, followed by their flying hours until the user types the word "DONE". Your program then analyze the values and print:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average number of flying hours (as a whole number)</li>
<li>The names of all pilots who flew less than the average number of flight hours.
<ul>
<li>Comparison to the average should be exclusive.</li>
<li>Names should be output in the same order as input</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
