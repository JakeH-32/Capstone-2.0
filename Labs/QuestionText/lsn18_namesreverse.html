<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</strong></p>
<p>Allow the user to enter names one at a time until they type the word 'END' (without quotes). This keyword is called a&nbsp;<strong>sentinel value,</strong>&nbsp;and it marks the end of the input. The user entered names (not counting 'END') are to be stored in a Python list. The user will enter the names one at a time. After entering all the names, your algorithm will print the names in the reverse order that they were entered.</p>

<p>You may assume that the user types at least one name.</p>

<p><strong>HINTS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remember that the range() function can have up to 3 parameters. The first is the starting value, the second is the ending value, and the third is the increment amount.</li>
<li>Don't forget that the index of a list starts at 0, and goes to the length of the list - 1. For example, a list with 5 elements has indices 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.</li>
<li>To get the length of a list, use the&nbsp;<code>len()</code>&nbsp;function</li>
</ul>
