<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>You have been provided with a function called get_fuel_consumption() that takes a distance in kilometers as a parameter, and calculates the fuel consumed (in gallons) by a 747 aircraft to travel this distance.</p>
<p>Call this function to determine how much fuel is consumed by a 747 when traveling 1500 kilometers. Store the returned result in a variable&nbsp;called fuel_consumed</p>
<p>Remember, "Calling a function" simply means typing in the name of the function (and providing it with any parameters that it needs--in this case, there are no parameters since there is nothing in the parenthesis).</p>
