<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>In Star Trek, starships travel across interstellar space at many times the speed of light.&nbsp; Due to the immense speeds involved, velocity in Star Trek is described using a fictitious unit of measurement known as a &ldquo;Warp Factor&rdquo;.&nbsp; For reference, Warp Factor 1.0 is equivalent to the speed of light, whereas Warp Factor 9.0 is more than 700 times faster!</p>
<p>Write a program that asks the user for the number of starships to analyze, as well as a target distance in light years.&nbsp; Your program will then get the name of each starship (e.g., "USS Enterprise) as well as its maximum cruise speed (e.g., 9.6), in that order.</p>
<p>Your program will then output the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of days it would take for the fastest starship to travel the target distance</li>
<li>The names of all ships that can travel the same distance within 7 days (inclusive) of the fastest time</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HINT:&nbsp; We have provided you with a function called calculate_travel_time, which takes a warp factor and distance as parameters, and returns the number of days it would take to travel that distance.&nbsp; Call this function to solve the problem.</strong></p>
