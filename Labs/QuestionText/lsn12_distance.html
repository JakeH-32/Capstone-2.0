<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong>Write a function that computes the distance between two points. You will name your function&nbsp;<code>dist_points</code>. It has four parameters, the cordinates of the two points as&nbsp;<code>x1, y1, x2, y2</code>. The&nbsp;<code>dist_points()</code>&nbsp;function will return the distance between the two points as a floating point number.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:<br /></strong>You are encouraged to write code to test your function. However, when you test against the server, only include the code for the function itself (you can comment out your test code).</p>
