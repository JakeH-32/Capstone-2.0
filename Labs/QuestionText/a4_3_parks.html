<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong>You have been provided with a table called <code>amusement_parks</code> that contains information about various amusement parks in the United States. Logically, the table can be represented as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Price Per Day</strong></td>
<td><strong>Name of Park</strong></td>
<td><strong>State</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$154.00</td>
<td>Disneyland</td>
<td>California</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$169.34</td>
<td>Disney World</td>
<td>Florida</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$79.99</td>
<td>Great America</td>
<td>California</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$73.00</td>
<td>Cedar Point</td>
<td>Ohio</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Write code that gets 1) the name of the park, 2) the state where the park is located, and 3) the price of a single day of admission from the user. Your program should then add a new row to the table containing these values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HINT:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you are creating your row, make sure you are adding the columns in the correct order!</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
