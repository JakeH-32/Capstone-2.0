<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong>Write a function that computes the area of a circle. You will name your function&nbsp;<code>area_circle</code>. It has one parameter, the radius of the circle,&nbsp;<code>radius</code>. The&nbsp;<code>area_circle()</code>&nbsp;function will return the area of the circle.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: <br /></strong>You are encouraged to write code to test your function. However, when you test against the server, only include the code for the function itself (you can comment out your test code).</p>
