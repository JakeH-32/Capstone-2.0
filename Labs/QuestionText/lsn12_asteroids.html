<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>"Asteroids" was an arcade game created in 1979 by Atari, Inc. In the game, the player is given control of a spaceship that has the ability to shoot bullets. The player is then placed in a field of floating rocks, and is tasked with destroying them without running into them.</p>
<p>In this lab, you will write a "collision detection" function that will be used by the game to determine if the player's ship has hit a rock. To make this simple, assume that an imaginary circle extends from the center of the asteroid and the player's ship (see below image). If the two circles ever overlap one another, then a collision has occurred. (NOTE: There are more accurate ways to detect a collision.&nbsp;<a href="https://bell0bytes.eu/basic-collision-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Click here if you want to learn more&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</a>).</p>

<p>Your function, which you will name&nbsp;<code>detect_collision()</code>&nbsp;should have six parameters: the (x, y) coordinates of the center of player's ship, the ship's radius, the (x, y) coordinates of the center of an asteroid, and the asteroid's radius. Your function will return&nbsp;<code>True</code>&nbsp;if the player's ship has hit the asteroid, and&nbsp;<code>False</code>&nbsp;otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>HINT: <em><br /></em></strong><em>You may want to copy and paste the</em>&nbsp;<code>dist_points</code>&nbsp;<em>function you created earlier. It's almost as if we are trying to demonstrate the importance of reusable functions . . .</em></p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:<br /></strong>You are encouraged to write code to test your function. However, when you test against the server, only include the code for the function itself (you can comment out your test code).</p>
