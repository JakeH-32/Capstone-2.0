<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</strong></p>
<p>You have been provided with a file named "cadets.csv" that contains information about (fake) cadets. Here is a line from the file:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><code>Karla Webber, Female, CS-17, 2020</code></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Each position in the line represents a different "data element." Here is a key for your reference:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table width="">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Gender</th>
<th>Squadron</th>
<th>Class Year</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Karla Webber</th>
<th>Female</th>
<th>CS-17</th>
<th>2020</th>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Write a Python program that opens the file and prints out the squadron number of each cadet. For example, if the first three cadets come from CS-03, CS-04, and CS-09, the first three lines of output should be:</p>
<pre>CS-03<br />CS-04<br />CS-09</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOTES:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your solution should print out the squadrons in the order that they were read from the file.</li>
<li>Your solution may print out the same squadron (e.g., CS-03) multiple times.</li>
</ul>
