<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>Recreational SCUBA divers have to plan out how many air tanks they will need in order to safely dive. The amount varies per diver because each person consumes air at a different rate. This rate is commonly called Surface Air Consumption. You want to figure whether you can afford the air requirements for the trips that you are planning.</p>
<p>Write an algorithm that asks for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The total dive time for the trip in minutes&nbsp;</li>
<li>The air budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your program should then output:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The number of liters needed for the project.</li>
<li>The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)</li>
<li>Either "Over Budget" or "Within Budget", depending on whether the cost of compressed air is greater than or not greater than the budget, respectfully.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assume that your Surface Air Consumption is <strong>14.5</strong> liters/minute, and that air costs <strong>2 cents</strong> per liter. You may assume that all inputs are non-negative numbers.</p>
