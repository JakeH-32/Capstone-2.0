<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<p>The Air Academy Federal Credit Union wants to identify its best customers and comes to you for help. To help with the accounting, create a Python program which inputs repeated pairs of member last-names followed by account balances until the word &ldquo;<strong>DONE</strong>&rdquo; (all capital letters) is entered at the member last-name prompt.</p>
<p>Your program should output:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last name of the member the highest account value, if there are two members with the same highest account value it should output the name of the first person entered.</li>
<li>It will then output the percentage members who are within $10,000 (inclusive) of the highest account value.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no bound on the number of members that may be entered, but you may assume that there will be at least one member and balance entered.</p>
