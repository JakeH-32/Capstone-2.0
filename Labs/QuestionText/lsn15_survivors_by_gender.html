<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>This program makes use of the Titanic dataset. Here is a typical line from the file:</p>
<p><code>0,3,Mr. Owen Harris Braund,male,22,1,0,7.25</code></p>
<p><br />As you will undoubtedly recall from class, each position in the line represents a different "data element". Here is a key for your reference:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;</th>
<th>Survived<br />(0=False; 1=True)</th>
<th>Class</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Gender</th>
<th>Age</th>
<th>Siblings/Spouses Aboard<br />(0=False; 1=True)</th>
<th>Parents/Children Aboard<br />(0=False; 1=True)</th>
<th>Fare</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>0</th>
<th>3</th>
<th>Mr. Owen Harris Braund</th>
<th>male</th>
<th>22</th>
<th>1</th>
<th>0</th>
<th>7.25</th>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br /><br />Write a Python algorithm that asks the user for the name of the file containing the titanic dataset, and counts how many males/females survived. Your program should print out each answer to a file called "result.txt".</p>
<p>For example, if 400 men, and 700 women survived, your output file should contain:<br />400<br />700</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: When you print to a file, make sure you put a new line at the end of each answer!</strong></p>
