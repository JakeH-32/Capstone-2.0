<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>Assume someone takes hundreds of photos on their smartphone every week. They are seeking the best and least expensive alternatives to store/share their images because their phone's storage capacity is limited. Using the table below, determine which storage options they should consider, assuming each image has an average file size of 6 MB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table border="1" width="">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Storage Option</strong></td>
<td><strong>Short Name</strong></td>
<td><strong>Number of Images (inclusive)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CD-ROM (700 MB)</td>
<td>CD</td>
<td>116</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DVD-ROM (4.7 GB)</td>
<td>DVD</td>
<td>780</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>USB Thumb Drive (16 GB)</td>
<td>USB Small</td>
<td>2660</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>USB Thumb Drive (64 GB)</td>
<td>USB Large</td>
<td>10600</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Portable Hard Drive (256 GB)</td>
<td>Portable HDD</td>
<td>42600</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br />Write a Python program that asks the user to enter the number of images that need to be shared/stored (non-negative, whole number). Then, referencing the table above, print out all the storage options (by Short Name) capable of holding that many images (one per line). If no storage options are capable of storing that many images, output "Consider Cloud Storage".</p>

<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td><strong>Example 1</strong></td>
<td><strong>Example 2</strong></td>
<td><strong>Example 3</strong></td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Input</strong></td>
<td>2000</td>
<td>4000</td>
<td>45000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Output</strong></td>
<td>USB Small<br />USB Large<br />Portable HDD</td>
<td>
<p>USB Large<br />Portable HDD</p>
</td>
<td>Consider Cloud Storage</td>
</tr>
