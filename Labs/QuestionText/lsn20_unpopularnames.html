<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>This lab makes use of the names.csv dataset, which provides a list of over 1200+ names that were given to children in 2011. Here is a typical line from the file:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>FEMALE, HISPANIC, GIA, 21</code></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different "data element". Here is a key for your reference:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Gender</th>
<th>Ethnicity</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Count<br />(i.e., Number of Children Assigned this Name)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>FEMALE</th>
<th>HISPANIC</th>
<th>GIA</th>
<th>21</th>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br /><br />Write a Python algorithm that gets a gender (all CAPs, "MALE" or "FEMALE") and a number,&nbsp;<code>X</code>, from the user, and prints out the X least popular names for that gender, starting with the most popular and working down.</p>
<p>For example, if the user types&nbsp;<code>MALE</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>2</code>, and you determine that the two least popular names are Bill and Ted, your program should output:</p>
<pre>Bill<br />Ted<br /><br /></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HINTS (really really important):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remember that you can use the&nbsp;<code>sort()</code>&nbsp;function to sort a list in ascending order. For example, if your list is named&nbsp;<code>my_list</code>, you can sort it by typing:<br /><code>my_list.sort()</code></li>
<li><code>sort()</code>&nbsp;will work on 2D lists. It will sort by the first column, and then look at the 2nd column in the event of a tie. Think about this when you are building your 2D list.</li>
</ul>
