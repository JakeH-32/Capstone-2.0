<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong>Define a function called <code>print_hello()</code>. Your function should, when called, simply print out a message of your choosing that would be a greeting to someone.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong><br />Functions only run when a program calls them. For the purposes of this exercise, you do not need to call the function. If you don't, however, nothing will appear on the screen when you run it in Thonny.</p>
