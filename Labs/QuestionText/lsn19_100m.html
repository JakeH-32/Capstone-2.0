<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</strong></p>
<p>You have been asked by your unit to record 100m dash times for an upcoming USAFA track meet. Create a Python algorithm that first asks for the number of cadets, and then asks for that many cadet last names, squadrons, and 100m dash times (in that order).</p>
<p>Your program should output:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cadet squadron containing the cadet with the fastest 100m dash time followed by their 100m dash time. If there is a tie for fastest 100m dash times, you should output the squadron number and time for the LAST cadet entered who had that fastest time.</li>
<li>The number of cadets whose 100m dash time was faster than the average.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no bound on the number of cadet that may be entered, but you may assume that there will be at least one cadet and track time entered.</p>
