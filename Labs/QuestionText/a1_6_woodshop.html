<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>You have a personal woodshop and want to easily calculate whether you can afford the board materials for a project. It is unlikely you can obtain the exact amount of board materials that you may need for the project because wood planks are provided in fixed lengths.</p>
<p>Write an algorithm that asks for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The total length of board materials required for the project</li>
<li>The budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your program should then output:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The number of boards needed for the project (Hint: use math.ceil(VALUE) to round up to the next full board).</li>
<li>The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)</li>
<li>Either "Over Budget" or "Within Budget", depending on whether the cost of boards is greater than or not greater than the budget, respectfully.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assume your local lumberyard sells each board in <strong>5.33</strong> feet pieces at <strong>$45.25</strong> per board. You may assume that all inputs are non-negative numbers.</p>
