<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong>In this lab, you are being given the freedom to explore&nbsp;<code>matplotlib</code>'s plotting capabilities.</p>
<p>The template ZIP file contains several interesting datasets that we have collected from the internet (although you are free to include any other dataset if you wish). Examine these datasets, and generate at least 2 "interesting" graphs. Each plot should use a different dataset. Additionally, each plot must be a different type (line and pie graph, etc)</p>
<p>Use the&nbsp;<code>subplot</code>&nbsp;feature to make sure all of the graphs fit on one screen. Most importantly, make sure you label your axes, give your charts a title, use color, etc.</p>
<p><br /><strong>HINT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use numpy's&nbsp;<code>genfromtxt</code>&nbsp;function to read the values in the file. If you forget how to use this function, refer to the lecture video.</li>
</ul>
