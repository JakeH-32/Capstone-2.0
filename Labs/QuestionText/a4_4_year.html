<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</strong></p>
<p>You have been provided with a file named "cadets.csv" that contains information about (fake) cadets. Here is a line from the file:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><code>Karla Webber, Female, CS-17, 2020</code></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Each position in the line represents a different "data element." Here is a key for your reference:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table width="">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Gender</th>
<th>Squadron</th>
<th>Class Year</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Karla Webber</th>
<th>Female</th>
<th>CS-17</th>
<th>2020</th>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Write a Python program that opens the file and prints out the Class Year of each cadet. For example, if the first three cadets come from 2020, 2019, 2020, the first three lines of output should be:</p>
<pre>2020<br />2019<br />2020</pre>
<p><strong>NOTES:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your solution should print out the years in the order that they were read from the file.</li>
<li>Your solution may print out the same year (e.g., 2020) multiple times.</li>
</ul>
