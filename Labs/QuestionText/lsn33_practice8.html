<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</strong></p>
<p>You have been provided with a file called oscar_age_male.csv, which contains information about male oscar award winners from the 1920s to 2015. Here is a typical line from the file:</p>
<pre>1928,44,Emil Jannings,The Last Command</pre>
<p>As always, each data element corresponds to a different piece of information. Here is a table that describes how to interpret each column:</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Year</strong></td>
<td><strong>Actor Age</strong></td>
<td><strong>Name</strong></td>
<td><strong>Film</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1928</td>
<td>44</td>
<td>Emil Jannings</td>
<td>The Last Command</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Write a Python program that reads this file, and gets the following inputs from the user:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>A start year</li>
<li>An end year</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your program should output the age of the youngest actor during that time span (including the start and end years), as well as the names of all actors that are within 5 years (inclusive) of the youngest age. For simplicity's sake, don't try to calculate the current age of the actors; just go with what is in the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if the youngest actor is 25, and the names of the actors within 5 years of the youngest age are Bob and Tom, your program should output:<br /><br />25<br />Bob<br />Tom</p>
