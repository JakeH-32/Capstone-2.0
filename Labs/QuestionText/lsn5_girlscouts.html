<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong>Write a program that asks the user for the amount of money he/she has on hand, and outputs the number of girl scout cookies that he/she can purchase. Use the following prices:</p>
<p>$5 per box for the "Super Six" (Thin Mints, Samoas, Tagalongs, Do-Si-Dos, Trefoils, Savannah Smiles)<br />$6 per box for the Specialty Cookies (S'mores, Toffee-tastic)</p>
<p><strong>For this problem, assume that the user will buy all of one or the other. In other words, output the number of boxes that he/she would be able to obtain if he/she bought nothing but the Super Six, and nothing but the Specialty Cookies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>HINT:</strong><br />You can convert a number to an integer by using the int() function. For example:<br /><strong>int(2.51)</strong> will convert the number to 2</p>
<p>EXAMPLE:<br />If the input is:</p>
<pre>26</pre>
<p>Then the output is:</p>
<pre>5 boxes of Thin Mints, Samoas, Tagalongs, Do-Si-Dos, Trefoils, or Savannah Smiles<br />4 boxes of S'mores and Toffee-tastic</pre>
