<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong>Write a function that determines if a point is within a circle. You will name your function <code>in_circle()</code>. It has five parameters:</p>
<ol>
<li>The coordinates of the point that is to be tested (x, y)</li>
<li>The center of a circle (cir_x, cir_y)</li>
<li>The radius of the circle (radius)</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;The <code>in_circle()</code> function will return <strong>True</strong> if the point is on or inside the circle, and <strong>False</strong> otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:<br /></strong>You are encouraged to write code to test your function. However, when you test against the server, only include the code for the function itself (you can comment out your test code).</p>
