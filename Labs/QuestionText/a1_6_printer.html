<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>A 3D printer converts computer generated models into physical objects by heating and extruding a filament known as Polylactic Acid (PLA). PLA, normally sold in spools, is directly fed to the printer head like a thread. You want to determine if you can afford to 3D print a project given its volume of material.</p>
<p>Write an algorithm that asks for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The volume of the 3D model to be printed (in cm<sup>3</sup>)</li>
<li>The user's budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your program should then output:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The length of material (in meters) needed to produce the object</li>
<li>The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign)</li>
<li>Either "Over Budget" or "Within Budget", depending on whether the cost of materials is greater than or not greater than the user's budget, respectfully.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Assume that each cm<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>requires<strong>&nbsp;0.312</strong>&nbsp;meters of PLA to print, and that PLA filament costs&nbsp;<strong>$0.063</strong>&nbsp;per meter. You may assume that all inputs are non-negative numbers.</p>
