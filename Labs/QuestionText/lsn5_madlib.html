<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong>Mad Libs are activities that have a person provide various words, which are then used to complete a short story in unexpected (and hopefully funny) ways. (EDITOR'S NOTE: Do you kids even do Mad Libs anymore?)</p>
<p>Complete the program to read the needed values from input, that the existing output statement(s) can use to output a short story.</p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong></p>
<p>If the input is:</p>
<pre><code>Eric
Chipotle
12
burritos
</code></pre>
<p>Then the output is:</p>
<pre><code>Eric went to Chipotle to buy 12 different types of burritos</code></pre>
