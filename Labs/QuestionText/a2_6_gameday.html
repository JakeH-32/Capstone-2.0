<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>The Academy Athletic Director asked you are to write a program that will determine whether or not a football game in progress should be delayed based on current weather conditions. Your program will ask for the number of lightning strikes occurred in the immediate area in the past thirty minutes. It will then ask for the distance from Falcon Stadium to each lightning strike (in miles, which do not have to be whole numbers). Your program will keep track of how many lightning strikes are within 15 miles of the stadium (inclusive). Your program will then print one of the following statements:</p>
<table border="1" width="">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong># of lightning strikes in immediate area</strong></td>
<td><strong>0</strong></td>
<td><strong>1-3</strong></td>
<td><strong>&gt;3</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Output</strong></td>
<td>All Clear</td>
<td>Weather Warning</td>
<td>Game Delay</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
