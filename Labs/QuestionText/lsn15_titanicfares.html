<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>This program makes use of the Titanic dataset. Here is a typical line from the file:</p>
<p><code>0,3,Mr. Owen Harris Braund,male,22,1,0,7.25</code></p>
<p><br />As you will undoubtedly recall from class, each position in the line represents a different "data element". Here is a key for your reference:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;</th>
<th>Survived<br />(0=False; 1=True)</th>
<th>Class</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Gender</th>
<th>Age</th>
<th>Siblings/Spouses Aboard<br />(0=False; 1=True)</th>
<th>Parents/Children Aboard<br />(0=False; 1=True)</th>
<th>Fare</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>0</th>
<th>3</th>
<th>Mr. Owen Harris Braund</th>
<th>male</th>
<th>22</th>
<th>1</th>
<th>0</th>
<th>7.25</th>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Write a Python algorithm that asks the user for the name of the file containing some or all of the Titanic dataset, as well as a passenger class (an integer between the values of 1 and 3). Your program should calculate the highest and lowest fare for that passenger class, and print out the result to a file called "result.txt".</p>
<p>For example, if the highest and lowest fare for 2nd class is $20 and $8, respectively, your output file should contain:</p>
<pre>20<br />8</pre>
<p><br /><strong>NOTES:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The values used in the above example are purely hypothetical. Your answers will be different.</li>
<li>Some passengers in the real dataset (like Jack in the movie Titanic--yes, I've seen it . . . don't judge me) have a fare of $0. To thoroughly test your code, we made a separate dataset (titanic2.csv) that removes these values.</li>
</ul>
