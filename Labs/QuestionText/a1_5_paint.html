<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>You are tasked to paint a large wall and need to see if your unit can afford the paint for the project</p>
<p>Write an algorithm that asks for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The size of the wall in square feet</li>
<li>The budget (in dollars--do not worry about the dollar sign)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your program should then output:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The amount of paint required to cover the wall</li>
<li>The estimated cost (in dollars--do not output a dollar sign, do not round to the nearest)</li>
<li>Either "Over Budget" or "Within Budget", depending on whether the cost of paint is greater than or not greater than the budget, respectfully.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Assume that a gallon of paint covers <strong>15</strong> square feet, and that the current price of paint is&nbsp;<strong>$12.23</strong>&nbsp;per gallon. You may assume that all inputs are non-negative numbers. You should also assume that you can purchase portions of gallons of paint so do NOT round up to the nearest full gallon.</p>
