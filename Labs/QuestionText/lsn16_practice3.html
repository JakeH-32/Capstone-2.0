<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong>You are writing a program to analyze the BMI of cadets. Write a program that asks for the number of cadets, and then gets that many weights and heights (alternating, a weight then the corresponding height, in that order). Your program should then output the number of thin, healthy, overweight, and obese cadets (based on their BMI), using the following formula and table as a guide:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BMI = 703 * (weight / height<sup>2</sup>)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Rating</strong></td>
<td><strong>BMI</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Thin</td>
<td>less than 18.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Healthy</td>
<td>at least 18.5 but less than 25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Overweight</td>
<td>at least 25 but less than 30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Obese</td>
<td>30 or more</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
