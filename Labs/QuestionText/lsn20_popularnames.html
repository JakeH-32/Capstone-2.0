<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>This program makes use of the names.csv dataset, which provides a list of over 1200+ names that were given to children in 2011. Here is a typical line from the file:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>FEMALE, HISPANIC, GIA, 21</code></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different "data element". Here is a key for your reference:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Gender</th>
<th>Ethnicity</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Count<br />(i.e., Number of Children Assigned this Name)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>FEMALE</th>
<th>HISPANIC</th>
<th>GIA</th>
<th>21</th>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br /><br />Write a Python algorithm that gets a number,&nbsp;<code>X</code>, from the user, and prints out the X most popular names, starting with the most popular and working down.</p>
<p>For example, if the user types&nbsp;<code>5</code>, and you determine that the five most popular names are Adrian, David, Bob, Jane, Ulysses, your program should output:<br />Adrian<br />David<br />Bob<br />Jane<br />Ulysses<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>HINTS (really really important):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remember that you can use the&nbsp;<code>sort()</code>&nbsp;function to sort a list in ascending order. For example, if your list is named&nbsp;<code>my_list</code>, you can sort it by typing:<br /><code>my_list.sort()</code></li>
<li>For this lab, you need to sort the list in descending order, so that the most popular items appear first. To do this, you need to tell the function to sort in reverse. You can do this by typing the following (assuming your list is named&nbsp;<code>my_list</code>):<br /><code>my_list.sort(reverse=True)</code></li>
<li><code>sort()</code>&nbsp;will work on 2D lists. It will sort by the first column, and then look at the 2nd column in the event of a tie. Think about this when you are building your 2D list.</li>
</ul>
