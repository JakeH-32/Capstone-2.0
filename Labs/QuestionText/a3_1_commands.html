<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>You have been provided with a list called&nbsp;<code>list_of_usaf_commands</code>. Write a program that prints a single, specified command organization from the list. Your program shall take a number via user input used to identify which command organization to print. For example, if the user types a 3, you should print out the third item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You may assume that the user will always enter a value that "should" exist within the list (e.g., the user will not enter 100 when the list only contains 5 elements)</li>
</ul>
