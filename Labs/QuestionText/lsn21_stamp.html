<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong>Create a pythonGraph function called&nbsp;<code>draw_stamp</code>&nbsp;that accepts an x and y coordinate as parameters. Add code so that this function will then draw a picture (of your choosing) centered on that coordinate. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To test your function, create a pythonGraph window, and call your function several times (each time, passing it a different set of x and y coordinates).</p>
