<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong>You have been provided with a list called list_of_run_times. Write a program that prints out the range (<em>i.e.,&nbsp;</em>the difference between the max and min run time)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE:<br /></strong>If, for example, the list contained the values: 3, 10, 15</p>
