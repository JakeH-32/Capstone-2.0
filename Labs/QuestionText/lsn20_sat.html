<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>This lab makes use of the sat.csv dataset, which describes the average SAT performance for students attending 350+ schools. Here is a typical line from the file:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>Henry Street School for International Studies, 391, 425, 385</code></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different "data element". Here is a key for your reference:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>School Name</th>
<th>Critical Reading Mean</th>
<th>Mathematics Mean</th>
<th>Writing Mean</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Henry Street School for International Studies</th>
<th>391</th>
<th>425</th>
<th>385</th>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br /><br />Write a Python algorithm that calculates the average SAT score across all schools, and outputs the names of every school that is below the average.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOTES (really really important):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can get a school's average score by adding up the critical reading, mathematics, and writing composite scores.</li>
</ul>
