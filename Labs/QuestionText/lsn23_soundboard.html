<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong>Using PythonGraph, create a "soundboard" application. Your program should display a list of colored buttons (i.e., rectangles). When the user clicks inside of a rectangle, the program plays a different sound.</p>
<p>The provided template file comes with a single button implemented. Your job is to study this code and create at least 5 other buttons. Note: The buttons do not have to be laid out in the same arrangement, but they should look organized.</p>
<p>When you are finished, upload your python code. Do NOT upload any of the sound files.</p>
