<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong>In, Python, write an algorithm that first asks the user how many football players they wish to enter statistics for and then gets that many yearly passing totals for each player. Output how many of those players that had more than 5000 passing yards in a year. Also your algorithm will output the average yardage per year as well as the minimum yardage entered, in that order. You can assume there is at least one player's yardage to input.</p>
