<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong>You have been provided with a table called <code>usaf_aircraft</code> that contains information about various aircraft in the United States Air Force inventory. Logically, the table can be represented as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Unit Price in Millions</strong></td>
<td><strong>Aircraft Name</strong></td>
<td><strong>Manufacturer</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$218</td>
<td>C-17 Globemaster</td>
<td>Boeing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$14.6</td>
<td>F-16 Falcon</td>
<td>General Dynamics</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$16.9</td>
<td>MQ-9 Reaper</td>
<td>General Atomics</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$737</td>
<td>B-2 Spirit</td>
<td>Northrop Grumman</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Write code that gets 1) Name of the Aircraft, 2) Manufacturer, and 3) the unit price in millions. Your program should then add a new row to the table containing these values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HINT:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you are creating your row, make sure you are adding the columns in the correct order!</li>
</ul>
