<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>This program makes use of the traffic.csv dataset. Here is a typical line from the file:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>691,6067 North,Kimball Ave,8/15/06,15600,North Bound:7500/South Bound:8100</code></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />As you will recall from class, each position in the line (separated by a comma) represents a different "data element". Here is a key for your reference:</p>
<table width="">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>ID</th>
<th>Address</th>
<th>Street</th>
<th>Sample Date</th>
<th>Total # of Passing Vehicles</th>
<th># of Vehicles by Direction</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>691</th>
<th>6067 North</th>
<th>Kimball Ave</th>
<th>8/15/06</th>
<th>15600</th>
<th>North Bound:7500/South Bound:8100</th>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br /><br />Write a Python algorithm that opens the file and outputs the lowest traffic count. Then, output the name of all streets whose traffic count is within 2500 (inclusive) of the min. Output one street name per line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if the min value is 500, and the roads within 2500 of this value are "Road A", "Road B", "Road C", then your program should output:</p>
<pre>500<br />Road A<br />Road B<br />Road C</pre>
