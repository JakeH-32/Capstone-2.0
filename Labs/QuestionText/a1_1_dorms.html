<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>Write the Python code needed to get three values from the user:</p>
<ol>
<li>A string representing the name of an USAFA dormitory (e.g., Vandenburg). Store this value in a variable called<strong> dorm</strong><strong>_name</strong></li>
<li>A floating point value representing the total area, in square feet, that the dormitory contains. Store this value in a variable called <strong>dorm_area</strong></li>
<li>An integer representing the number cadets living in this dormitory. Store this value in a variable called <strong>dorm_population</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Your template file contains a print statement that combines these values to produce an output (see Example). <strong>Do not modify this line.</strong> Simply add your input statements in the space provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong></p>
<p>If the user types "Vandenberg", 63383.5, and 1720, your program should print:</p>
<pre>The Vandenburg dormitory has an area of 63383.5 square feet and has 1720 cadets living in it.</pre>
