<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>One way bits can hold information is computer images. Computer images are composed of a grid of small, independent colored cells known as pixels. The number of colors each pixel can hold is related to the number bits allocated to each pixel. A simple black and white image, for example, would have a single bit per pixel, where the value of the bit would represent black or white for that pixel. Allocating 2 bits per pixel would allow each pixel to have one of four colors.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the number of color options available to a particular pixel can be described as:</p>
<pre>numberofcolors = 2<sup>number of bits</sup></pre>
<p>In Python, write an algorithm that prompts the user for a number of bits and then outputs the number of different colors that could be represented by a single pixel.</p>
