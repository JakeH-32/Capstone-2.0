<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Write the Python code needed to get three values from the user:</p>
<ol>
<li>A string representing the name of an aircraft (e.g., F-16). Store this value in a variable called&nbsp;<strong>aircraft_name</strong></li>
<li>A floating point value representing the maximum speed of the aircraft. Store this value in a variable called&nbsp;<strong>aircraft_speed</strong></li>
<li>An integer representing the number of airplanes of this type owned by the USAF. Store this value in a variable called&nbsp;<strong>quantity</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Your template file contains a print statement that combines these values to produce an output (see Example). <strong>Do not modify this line.</strong> Simply add your input statements in the space provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong></p>
<p>If the user types "F-16", 1500.1, and 600, your program should print:</p>
<pre>The F-16 has a top speed of 1500.1 MPH. The USAF has 600 in its inventory. </pre>
