<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong>You have been asked to write a program that analyzes the results acquired from several flight tests executed last week. Write a program that gets from the user the number flight tests preformed, and gets the result from each flight (which you may assume are whole numbers) from the user. Your program must print out:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average result for the flight tests.</li>
<li>The count of flight tests that scored below the average.</li>
</ul>
