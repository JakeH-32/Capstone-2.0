<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>You are going to be given values for a dictionary. These will be an historic landmark as the key and the location of that landmark as the value. You will continue to receive input until the user types "DONE". </p>
<p>After the dictionary is populated, get a landmark key as an input from the user and print the location where the landmark is. If the landmark isn't in the dictionary, print "Landmark not found".</p>
