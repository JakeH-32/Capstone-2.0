<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>You are writing a program that will help you decide if there are too many people at a restaurant for you to dine safely. Your program will ask for the number of people in the restaurant. It will then ask for the distance between yourself and each of the people (in feet, which do not have to be whole numbers). Your program will keep track of how many people are within 6 feet of you (inclusive). Your program will then print one of the following statements:</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong># of People within 6 Feet</strong></td>
<td><strong>0</strong></td>
<td><strong>1-2</strong></td>
<td><strong>&gt;2</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Output</strong></td>
<td>All Clear</td>
<td>Warning</td>
<td>Find Another Place</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLES:</strong></p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td><strong>Example 1</strong></td>
<td><strong>Example 2</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>INPUT</strong></td>
<td>3<br />5.7<br />10.2<br />12.4</td>
<td>2<br />7.0<br />15.1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>OUTPUT</strong></td>
<td>Warning</td>
<td>All Clear</td>
</tr>
