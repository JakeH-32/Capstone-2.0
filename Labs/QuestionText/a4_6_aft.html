<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</strong></p>
<p>You have been asked to write a program to assess student's performance on the AFT. Write a Python program that asks the user to repeatedly type in the name of a cadet, followed by their run time (in whole seconds) until the user types the word "DONE". Your program then analyze the values and print:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fastest (lowest) AFT time.</li>
<li>The names of all cadets who were within 30 seconds of the fastest time.
<ul>
<li>Comparison to the target time should be exclusive.</li>
<li>Names should be output in the same order as input</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
