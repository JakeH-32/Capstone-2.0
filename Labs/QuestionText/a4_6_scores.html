<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</strong></p>
<p>You have been asked to write a program to assess student's performance on a recent test. Write a Python program that asks the user to repeatedly type in the name of a cadet, followed by their test score (between 0 and 100) until the user types the word "DONE". Your program then analyze the values and print:</p>
<ul>
<li>The highest overall test score (just score, not the name)</li>
<li>The names of all cadets who scored within 10 points of the highest score.
<ul>
<li>Comparison to the target score should be exclusive.</li>
<li>The names should be output in the same order of input.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
