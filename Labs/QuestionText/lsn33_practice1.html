<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br /></strong></p>
<p>Write a Python program that keeps asking the user for positive integers until the user types -1.</p>
<p>Your program will then output the following:</p>
<ul>
<li># of even numbers</li>
<li>Average of all the even numbers (if no even numbers were input, print 0)</li>
<li># of odd numbers</li>
<li>Average of all the odd numbers (if no odd numbers were input, print 0)</li>
</ul>
<p>You may assume that the user will type AT LEAST one number. You cannot assume, however, that the user will enter both an odd and even number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HINT:<br />Use the mod function to determine if a number is even or odd<br /><br />print(5 % 2) will print "1" because there is a remainder of 1 when you divide 5 by 2</p>
<p>print(4 % 2) will print "0" because there is no remainder when you divide 4 by 2</p>
