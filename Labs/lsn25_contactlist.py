# Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that stores names and phone numbers
# for your classmates.  Your program will keep asking the user to input names and
# phone numbers until he/she types "DONE".
# Your program will then store the names/numbers in a dictionary,
# and allow the user to repeatedly type in names until he/she types "DONE".  
#    - If name is in the contact list, your program will output the corresponding phone number.  
#    - If the name is **not** in the contact list, your program will output "NOT FOUND"
