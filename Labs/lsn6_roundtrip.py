# Lab: Lesson 6, Round Trip
# Course: CS110
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that gets three values from the user:
#    - The distance to a destination (in miles)
#    - The amount of fuel in the user's car (in gallons)
#    - The # of miles the user's car can travel per gallon of gas
#
# Calculate the percentage of fuel currently in the car that's needed to reach the destination.
# Then output whether or not the user needs to refuel, using the table in the lab as a guide.
# 
# For example, if 10 gallons are required and there are 10 gallons in the car,
# the percentage is 1.0 (100%) or if 5 gallons are required and there are 10 gallons
# in the car the percentage of fuel consumed is 0.5 (50%).
