# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
# You have been provided with the template code for an animation.
# Study the code for a minute, then modify the code to do the following WHEN THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON IS HELD DOWN:
#    1.  Write the code needed to get the mouse's x and y coordinates
#    2.  Draw a circle centered at the mouse's x and y coordinates
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Setup Tasks for the Window
pythonGraph.open_window(600, 600)
pythonGraph.set_window_title("Lsn 20 - Mouse Button Example")

# Animation Loop
# DO NOT TOUCH!
while pythonGraph.window_not_closed():
       
    # Check to see if the mouse's left button is down
    if pythonGraph.mouse_button_down("LEFT"):
        
        # You can delete this line if you want (or leave it in; doesn't matter)
        pass
        
        # Get the X and Y coordinates of the mouse, and store them in variables


    
        # Draw a circle at the mouse's current x,y coordinates


    
    # Shows All Drawings Above
