# Problem Statement: You are writing a program to determine which aircraft
# can fly in formation based on their cruise speed.  Write a python program
# that asks the user for:
#  1.  The number of aircraft to analyze
#  2.  The target cruise velocity, in mph
#
# Your program will then repeatedly ask the user for the designator for each aircraft
# and its cruise velocity.  Once all of the values have been input, your
# program will output:
#  1.  The NUMBER of aircraft whose cruise velocity is within 50mph of the target (above or below, inclusive)
#  2.  The designator of each aircraft that meets the above criteria
