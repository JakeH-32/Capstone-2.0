#   Simple Pig Latins rule:
#     If the word starts with a vowel, add 'way' to the end of the word
#     If the word starts with a consonant, take the first letter, put it on the end of the word and ad 'ay' to the end

# Write a function called pig_latin that takes a string of words and returns it converted to pig latin.

# Example:
#    print pig_latin("Lets test this out") --- prints this -- > 'etsLay esttay histay outway '
#    print pig_latin("Rick Astley is my hero") --- prints this -- > 'ickRay Astleyway isway ymay erohay '
