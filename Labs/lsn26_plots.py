# Problem Statement:  The template ZIP file contains several interesting
# datasets that we have collected from the internet (although you are free to
# include any other dataset if you wish). Examine these datasets, and generate
# at least 2 "interesting" graphs. Each plot should use a different dataset.
# Additionally, each plot must be a different type (line and pie graph, etc)
#
# Use the subplot feature to make sure all of the graphs fit on one screen.
# Most importantly, make sure you label your axes, give your charts a title, use color, etc.
