# Problem Statement:   Create a Python algorithm that first asks for the
# number of cadets, and then asks for that many cadet last names, squadrons,
# and 100m dash times (in that order).
# Your program should output:
#    - The cadet squadron with the fastest 100m dash time followed by their 100m dash time.
#    - The number of cadets whose 100m dash time was faster than the average (inclusive).
