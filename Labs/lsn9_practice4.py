# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
# Write a program that asks the user for the area of three plots of land.
#    - The first area will be provided to you in ACRES
#    - The second area will be provided to you in SQUARE MILES
#    - The third area will be provided to you in SQUARE KILOMETERS
# Your program will output "Plot X is the biggest", replacing X with either a 1, 2, or 3
# depending on if the first, second, or third plot is the biggest, respectively.
# You may assume that the plots DO NOT have equivalent areas
